It turns out Consular Officers have complete authority in choosing who and who does not get a visa.

This is the best I can give - it's not perfect, but I believe this to be my biggest accomplishment of thought on the subject.

&nbsp;

--- ""The Utopian Government"" ---

&nbsp;

Since the dawn of our age, man has worked to serve his interests, whatever they may be.

&nbsp;

Most men work arduously to protect their interests, to achieve, and to succeed. The problem is that when men are given power over others, the temptation to continue this way is often too difficult to resist. Even in the most important positions in government, men often find themselves at odds with the best interests of the people and, and over time people become complacent with this. However, at some point, this way is destined to fail. When it does it should be replaced with something that eliminates this possibility. It should be replaced with a utopian government.

&nbsp;

The utopian government is designed as a way to align the interests of those in government with the interests of the people, or at least to prevent conflicts of interest for those in government.

&nbsp;

The rules are simple and there are only 10. Some may consider some of these rules to be controversial, but if we intend to continue our civilization and to maintain our freedoms and to be served by a government that has our interests at heart, then this is the way.

&nbsp;

The principle is simple. All members of the Federal Government (President, Congress, Judges, etc.) are servants to the people. Their service is selfless and endless. Their integrity and commitment must be total, and their motives transparent and solely for the betterment of the society.

&nbsp;

Here are the rules.

&nbsp;

Rule #1: No member of government (President, Congress, Judges, etc.) is allowed to own personal property – no checking account, no investments, no car, no jewelry, no business… nothing.

&nbsp;

Rule #2: No spouse of any member of government is allowed to own personal property. The spouse of any member may seek or maintain employment. However, employment must be without compensation.

&nbsp;

Rule #3: At the time the member takes office for the first time, they will have a limited number of options for divesting their personal wealth: donate all wealth to a charity of their choice, donate all wealth to the repayment of the federal deficit, give a one-time gift not to exceed $10,000 per person to any child or grandchild, or any combination of the above.

&nbsp;

Rule #4: Members of government will be provided a stipend each year. This stipend will be equal to an initial amount of ½ of the average wage in the country. Each year this amount will be increased or decreased by the average increase or decrease in worker wages in the country. This stipend may be used to buy food, trips, entertainment, etc. However, at no point may the stipend be used to purchase anything that can be considered personal property.

&nbsp;

Rule #5: The stipend paid to each member of government will only be accessible via a credit card. All receipts for purchases made on the credit card will be published publicly at least monthly. The public will have the ability to view every receipt and a record of all transactions on the internet at all times.

&nbsp;

Rule #6: All members of government will have provided to them and their immediate family (spouse, children, and any other individuals that are solely dependent on the member): a modest furnished house large enough to support their immediate family and dependents, food, clothing, healthcare, basic living necessities (personal hygiene products, cooking utensils, etc.) and transportation.

&nbsp;

Rule #7: All provisions above will persist for the duration of the longer of the member’s life, the life of their spouse, or the life of their dependent’s life if the dependent is under the age of 21, or until the dependent reaches the age of 21.

&nbsp;

Rule #8: All members of government may serve for as long as they choose up to a maximum of 20 years. After this time, they are released from service. However, all provisions above still apply. Members may choose to seek employment. However, employment it must be without compensation.

&nbsp;

Rule #9: No member of the government or public is allowed to spend any money to advertise or campaign for office. Instead, those wishing to seek a position in government will be subjected to a criminal background check, a check to see if they have ever filed bankruptcy, and a check to see if they have any current civil or criminal cases pending against them. Provided they pass these checks, each candidate will be provided a free online “blog” that is accessible to all members of the public. Each member may post videos, pictures, documents, etc. in order to encourage voters to elect them to office.

&nbsp;

Rule #10: Any member of government found to have violated his commitment to service and leadership by committing a crime (other than minor crimes such as a receiving a parking ticket, etc.) or found to be in violation of the rules above, such as private ownership of personal property, shall be given the choice to be either exiled from the country or executed in public.

37,Where do I start with my local government?,3,30rk0f,government,https://www.reddit.com/r/government/comments/30rk0f/where_do_i_start_with_my_local_government/,4,"I am about to dive into something that I know almost nothing about. In my home town we have a skate park that the city built a few years ago. It is a pretty nice park and almost all of the skateboarders, rollerbladers, and scooter(-ers?), frequent it daily. Our town is pretty small, but this park pulls an impressively large crowd almost every day. There is just one problem. It closes at dusk everyday. 

This doesn't seem like much of a problem, and honestly, it makes a lot of sense from the standpoint of the city. Their reasoning is that they close the park at night to prevent any acts of vandalism that may occur when no one is there on watch. While this seems like it's a fair compromise for having a free city-sponsored skate park for the community to enjoy, there are a few discrepancies that give the subject a harsher tone.

For one, there is a tennis court located no more than 500 feet away from the skate park that was also funded by the local government that is open 24/7 and has several stadium worthy lights lighting the court at all times. There is also a baseball field located on the opposite side at approximately the same distance as the tennis court that is also city funded and lit year-round as well.

Personally, I think that this is a cold cut case of stereotyping. (Not that I am trying to handle the situation with any mode of subjective involvement.) I just don't think it's fair, and neither do any of the patrons of the skate park. One kid, I remember, actually put together a petition and got about a hundred signatures asking for the city to put up some lights so that they could skate after dark. The council agreed to meet on the subject and, at the last minute, cancelled. He gave up right there. (Which I think was a mistake.)

All these guys are asking for is more time to have fun. The people who go up to this park are a community among themselves and they always keep the park clean, and in the few years that the park has been open there hasn't been a single act of vandalism. Not even a little graffiti. Some of these skaters work all day and are forced to break the law just to skate because the park closes too early. 

Essentially what I am asking for here is advice. I am not extremely savvy in the field of local politics, but I want to help these guys. I am inquiring about three things in this post:

1. Where do I start and who do I talk to?

2. How do I get the city to listen to your average citizen?

3. What are the legal options available to me?

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks for reading.

Are the cohabitant's relatives okay? Then for the address after living with her I was going to put her on their since we we're no longer dating but still friends. Is either of these okay to put?

Article I, Section 2, of The U.S. Constitution states, in part:

>The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand [representees]

In the first third on the 20th century, the U.S. ossified the number of representatives at 435.  With the current population of the United States exceeding 300 Million, the ratio is at about one per 700,000.

What is the natural population limit of a republican government?

If every representee were given equal time with his or her representative, over an 2,000 hour work year, that amounts to 10 seconds before the representative per person per year, at the moment.  On the other hand, if we consider the capacity of the largest in-person (non-internet) public venues - certain college football stadiums hold 100,000 spectators - and double it to 200,000 for the non-participatory, we are left pondering a factor of 7/2, 3.5.

I could belabor what I esteem to be the advantages of a more truly representative government, - an educated populace being the key to moral governance of a free people being perhaps the greatest, - but I will leave this post dry of the like from here.  If we did increase the degree of representation by a factor of 7/2, we'd have a House of 1500.  Is this *prima facie* unweildy, and absurd?  What then would that say of the capacity of a representative to represent even 30,000?  Interestingly 30,000^2, is 900 Million.  China and India both have populations in excess of this (which means, if they apportioned one representative for every 30,000, they would need more than 30,000 representatives).

What is the natural population limit of a republican government?

The earth's population is roughly 7 Billion at the moment: can we conclude that a one world government *could* function as a republic, and that thus we need not consider this question further?  Not that we should expect that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would jump on board ;-)

Thomas Jefferson was invited to attend the festivities celebrating its fiftieth anniversary on the 4th of July in Washington, D.C. along with the other surviving members of those who signed the Declaration. Jefferson was too ill to attend and sent the letter below declining the invitation. It is one of the last letters he wrote. He died a month or so later.  Remarkably, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, lifelong colleagues, and correspondents until the end, both died on July 4th, 1826, exactly 50 years after signing of the Declaration of Independence. This letter inspires me every time I read it;

""Mr. Weightman,

The kind invitation I received from you, on the part of the citizens of the city of Washington, to be present with them at their celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of American Independence, as one of the surviving signers of an instrument pregnant with our own, and the fate of the world, is most flattering to myself, and heightened by the honorable accompaniment proposed for the comfort of such a journey. It adds sensibly to the sufferings of sickness, to be deprived by it of a personal participation in the rejoicings of that day. But acquiescence is a duty, under circumstances not placed among those we are permitted to control.  I should, indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and exchanged there congratulations personally with the small band, the remnant of that host of worthies, who joined with us on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we were to make for our country, between submission and the sword; and to have enjoyed with them the consolatory fact that our fellow citizens, after half a century, of experience and prosperity, continue to approve the choice we made. May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all,) the signal of arousing men to burst their chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form which we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollection of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.

I will ask permission here to express the pleasure with which I should have met my ancient neighbors of the city of Washington and its vicinities, with whom I passed so many years of a pleasing social intercourse; an intercourse which so much relieved the anxieties of the public cares, and left impressions so deeply engraved in my affections, as never to be forgotten. With my regret that ill health forbids me the gratification of an acceptance, be pleased to receive for yourself, and those for whom you write, the assurance of my highest respect and affections.""

They accepted that they made a mistake and I should get a different SSN than my sister as I applied for SSN after her. They filed an application for a new SSN for me because that was the right thing to do. A week later I get the SSN. Guess what, they messed it up even further. They gave me my sister's SSN and completely deleted my sister's records. I again went to my local SSN office on June 6. They again assured me that they will fix this issue i.e. correct my sister's records and issue me new SSN. I received the new SSN on June 19, 2014 and the number is still the same (i.e. same as my sister's). I  have moved out of the state where the SSN was issued and have started my new job.

I am reading the instructions for the EQIP questionnaire that I am to fill out tomorrow. A few questions:

This one is probably a given, but I am to list every employer that gave me a paycheck in the last 7 years, right? Even if I worked for them for a day?

The next section mentions financial questions. It says be sure to list any debts past due. I know that there was something that I didn't pay until a year later, think it had to do with my car insurance, but I honestly can't remember. There may have been one instance of me not paying a credit card bill on time when I first got a card. I guess the question is, what if you honestly just can't remember? 

Another credit question, but it mentions ""credit issues…if listed please state amounts etc."". So this applies to any balance on a credit card, even if you've never had a late payment? I have 2 credit cards, one with $8000 on it, and the other with $500. I pay the minimum payment on time every month. Will this reflect negatively on me, even if my credit score is pretty good?

For personal reference, someone you've known for 7 years or more, can you list a family member?

As far as criminal records go, do I have to list a case that I got expunged last year? Will I get the question about past drug use and have to disclose the skeletons of my teenage closet? Ive met people who have clearances that lied about this sort of thing, and have told the truth, and both ended up getting granted. 

I don't understand how people end up losing their clearance later on though. If somebody said they never smoked weed, then 10 years later lose their clearance because it was found out that they lied, how does this happen? Did the person just come out and confess?

Also, are there any negative side effects to being denied? I am reading about some people who think it may be better to withdrawal than to get denied. Why is this? Cant you just try again in the future?

I know that some of these questions I shouldn't even have to really ask, but I want to be 100% sure before I fill it out. Thank you.",1401867404.0

I think it would be set up by having the user go to the site and type in their yearly income, where they live, etc. They'd fill out whatever criteria necessary to get a very good estimation of what they pay in taxes. Then they'd be taken to a flow chart where to the left part of the screen is the dollar amount that they paid in taxes to the federal government and you would see branches extending to the right breaking down in dollars what money went to which bureaus and departments of government as well as which policies allocated that money.

Judicial activism is when a judge goes beyond their basic duty of interpreting law, and, instead, rules based upon their personal or political opinions of a party in the case to further the Constitutional rights of citizens.

I'm Tyler, an author of [Wiki-gov](http://wiki-gov.com). The site is still in its infancy, but the idea behind it is to create a consensus government based on the collaborative principles of wikipedia. We attempt to solve most of the problems of government by eliminating the barriers to entry for everyone to contribute, and create a fully thorough democracy, absent of elected representatives.

Its tough to eliminate money in politics, but the easiest way is to eliminate paid representatives. When you have a small # of reps, bribery is pretty simple. But when your representatives become every internet citizen, it makes bribery a bit tougher. In the style of wikipedia, there is no hierarchy; every internet-user has equal access to edit the documents and start discussions. This doesn't mean equality of ability, as some will have more expertise than others. As is (mostly) the case on reddit, the best arguments will cite references/studies to back up their statements.

The main technical challenges of the site are integrating with reddit(Reddit isn't kind enough to provide a direct javascript embed of articles :P). If Reddit discussion threads and wiki talk pages were in a boxing match, wiki would be knocked out in the first round. And, one of the challenges for the wiki being to accurately represent democratic sentiment, I've created a system that integrates with a [Wiki-gov subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wikigov/) using RSS feeds. Every article on the wiki searches the subreddit for its name, so that associated discussions are quickly and easily linked to, directly from the page. I've also added DISQUS threads, in case people would rather use those for reaching consensus. 

If you have an idea for improving government, have special expertise, or have a debate with a fellow redditor, wiki-gov would be a great place to put the results. 

We have some lofty [Goals](http://wiki-gov.com/wiki/index.php?title=Goals) , but once things get more developed, we can at least hope to inform governments about what users of the interwebs want their governments to be and do.

Lots of paper-pushing and unnecessary red-tape. I'm trying to ignite change, but as a VERY low-level employee, the most I can do right now is be honest with people about my job and how I feel about it -- brutally so, at times.

I figured I'd share an email I got today that made me chuckle. I've edited information out so that HOPEFULLY nobody is identified. Because as much as I dislike my environment, I need the job. At least until I can start making money on my hobby. 

Anyway, here it is:

""A few concerns (with [things]) in [internal system] have come up for some [department] staff this morning.  Apparently only those using Google Chrome are having any issues.  This is not surprising.

Google Chrome is not only non-standard software for State computers and not supported by OIT,  but Chrome is seriously problematic.  I know from my own experience at the [other] office that more than one user had their entire computer—all the programs, data, etc.—crashed as a result of Chrome.  Others had less catastrophic but still seriously problematic concerns arise as a result of the use of it.  So it was outlawed there, so to speak.  [Director] tells me that there have been previous concerns raised here at the [my job] as well (before my time here—but perhaps you will recall them).

Speaking with [Director of another department] this morning, I understand that there is not an absolute ban on Chrome by OIT.  But if you use it, you do so at your peril.  The problem with “your peril” is that it can affect others.  Because what each of us does on [our system] affects other people’s work—not to mention utilities and consumers, we cannot afford to use Google Chrome to access [our system].  I understand there has been discussion in the past with [employee] from OIT with some staff about Chrome being helpful with [our system].  And I understand that there a number of aspects of Chrome that many folks find advantageous.  Be those things as they may, from now on, none of us should use Google Chrome to run [our system] and I strongly recommend you get it off your system.  Let’s stick to Explorer, which is not only supported by OIT but is the assumed platform for [our system].  In a nutshell, we already have enough issues with [our system] alone—we cannot afford to be having additional ones that are not due to [our system] but to another program over which we have no control and for which we can receive no assistance.  

If you have any questions or concerns about this directive, please let me know.  If you have any questions in general about your using/downloading/maintaining any non-State issued software on your computer (all of which are seriously problematic for reasons we’ve discussed previously), please let me know.  I am guessing that you’ll be all set, but I will re-check in with you all about this at our staff meeting on Friday to be sure.

Thanks for your help with ensuring we keep our prime data base as sound as we possibly can—I really appreciate it!""",1380156371.0

Recently, Ed Snowden leaked critical information on how intelligence is gathered and more importantly, the large volume and reasoning behind doing so.

First off, it means that the government is taking power into their own hands. Think about that sentence for a minute: the shining beacon of democracy and northern star of justice just slipped and shushed (and by the way internally justified the time and money to process) billions of gigabits of data, from you and me! What the fuck, right? My beloved baby, she can't help a poor college student with his (more likely her) American Dream, but don't worry if little Sally across the street plans anything terroristy (my new adjective), we got your back. What the hell happened to believing people aren't terrible? Unfortunately, me typing this fucking thing won't do anything, and you reading it won't either. This is why I make the argument that the internet has crippled free speech. 

I can type this and bitch, it makes me feel better. You can read this, up it, and bitch with me (I hope you feel better too). Then we say, ""Alright did my job in this matter, time to make a frozen pizza and enjoy my life again."" Wait, wait, wait, wait, what the fuck man, I don't want to be that fat herd waiting to be driven blindly to the slaughter house. I know the couch is calling, but local action and reaching out to your representatives and saying, ""hey fucker I do my job as best as I can, so you should too"", really is all we need! Hooray for knowing the answer is literally in your pocket! Pre-heat that son of a bitch, make your call (be sure to be as much of a dick as possible, because lady liberty seriously is listening), and make sure your representative receives it and not some innocent intern not knowing what the fuck he or she did wrong to deserve this.  Last thing, if you read this and thought, ""well I don't think my life is bad at all, America is still going strong and my couch is pretty nice"", well refer to my list of things to improve on, THAT MATTER.

1. Public school ratings, budgets, graduation rates in large cities.
2. Cost of college education and how important it is to have. (By the way, ever take a look at your colleges budget? do it.)
3. Infrastructure, where's my high speed rail train? I wanna see NY and California in the same vacation!)
4. Cost of food and food stamp program. (You have no soul if it doesn't bother you we spend millions in NSA programs, yet don't feel like feeding the hungry (ahem The House)) By the way, we spent about 20 billion subsidizing no calorie foods like corn syrup and just 515 million on apples since 1995 which are the only fruit/veggie that receives funding.

I'm writing a script for a high-school class based on government manipulation of the public. If anyone here is familiar with non-realistic theater, it's that. 

I figured that this would be a good subreddit to ask for sources on most things government related, so if you guys have anything appropriate (As in, I can use it in an academic paper), I would much appreciate it. So far, googling ""government"" followed by ""manipulation"", ""control"", or any variation thereof just throws me at a bunch of conspiracy theory websites... which I obviously can't use for an academic paper (Which has to accompany my script).

If you can't provide sources, even providing examples of the government manipulating the general populace would be fantastic. (I've already noted North/Best Korea, Japan, China, the Middle East and some of the WW2/WW1 propaganda, though I am wondering if the Cold War would be worth mentioning or looking into. Likewise the Vietnam or Korea wars.)

The Process at a National Level:
1.	Five to eleven of the well-educated Doctors and researchers, whose academic knowledge and studies pertain to a facet of society, are randomly selected throughout different states to give their ideal from expert opinions on a specific element of a broad topic.  They have no knowledge of who else is working on this project as to not bias or influence their opinions in their responses.

Ph. D.s in Education and Educational Psychology receive a packet noting a specific construct stemming from their fields of expertise, such as Education SystemPhysical Classroom Environment. Prompt words would be provided to give a detailed opinion/set of facts over the inner workings of that construct.
 Prompts such as physical structure, color of walls, positioning of seats, positioning and use of blackboard/projectors/computer screens.

2.	After a year has passed, the participants will submit their reports to the government.  The reports will then be electronically sent to two to three other graduate leveled men or women in the respective fields and told to tally up the most identical reports of the ideal element—individually and anonymously just as the first set of participants conducted their ideas—and then sent back to the government.

The doctors and researchers will send back their work after a year and the government will delete any identifying information about the authors and then collect and distribute the packet of responses to two to three other men and/or women of the same stature, who are under the same conditions of anonymity and confidentiality as the first experts were.  Their only job is to read and match up reports that are similar in nature, mark them, tally all the reports as a whole, and send them back to the government.  They are not given any right to administer their input or biases on the work they read or interpret.  They are only given one month to do this.

3.	After receiving the papers, an appointed person will look at the marks and tallies from the entire second group of participants, and declare which idea(s) are most common and set those papers aside from the others.  This person will be followed up by one other person’s notice of the tallies to be sure it is a reliable assessment.

Once the papers are marked and sent back to the government, a person will be appointed solely for the purpose of looking at all the tallied papers and choosing the papers which are most noted to be similar. (One person looks over 5-11 papers on the basis of 2-3 people tallying them, and chooses the most tallied papers overall).  This assessment is double-checked by one other person agreeing with the same judgment.

4.	Once a baseline for ideals (popular responses) is assessed, those papers will be placed in a separate stack and a congregation of experts in that field are pooled (the pool excludes those who have contributed thus far to the issue at hand) to meet.  The randomized group of people will be presented with a short synopsis of the reports and be asked to converse with one another on what the best ways are to implement the ideals of these reports. 

The papers are separated from common ideas to non-common ideas, the papers are synopsized, with bullets for each idea, and a meeting of experts who were previously of the loop of this cycle is called in to contribute the best ways to transform the ideals into reality.

5.	Once a clear, concise model is derived, that will be the state of which the element is administered in.

Ex. All schools will have classrooms with blue painted walls, X style chairs, spaced out in an order of Y geometrical shape, with a black board for teaching.  And this is stated to be the best environment to foster learning.

I just have a few notes from my government class that I would like to discuss.

Obscenity apparently is determined by *community standards*, and not considered legally obscene unless the act or statement:
* appeals to prurient (sexual) interest
* depicts, in an offensive way, sexual conduct prohibited by law
* lacks serious literary/artistic/political/scientific value

Here is what I don't understand. What exactly is meant by *community standards*? Are randomly selected citizens being questions on what they personally believe is obscene? Where is the line that separates obscene from non-obscene acts? What about the depiction of sexual conduct prohibited by law? Does that mean it's illegal for a woman to walk down a main street dressed like a hooker? What about freedom of expression?

I would greatly appreciate somebody clearing all this up for me. I'm taking the midterm in my class in about 40 minuets, and want to know as much as I can for when I take it. I will still read responses afterward though, since I'm still curious about the subject outside the classroom. But for now I have more studying to do.

So, back story.  My ex wife has kept me from seeing my kids for 9 years.  The whole time moving 9 times to different states and cashing that child support check.  Oh, and she has 6 kids with her boyfriend after my 2 kids.  Not even exaggerating.  So, I get a letter 1 year ago saying that there is an investigation.  My ex's boyfriend is under investigation for touching my 12 year old daughter.  

Now I am angry.  Beg, borrow steal and do what I have to in order to get 5 grand to pay a lawyer.  This is going to stop.   I am going to see my kids.  

Get court ordered phone talks twice a week and I get to drive to where they live one weekend a month for 4 months.  So, on top of the child support, on top of the lawyer, I now spend huge amounts of money monthly to go and see my kids as well as take 2 days off of work every month.  I have to drive 8 hours to where they live, pay for 4 nights in a hotel, then drive home the 8 hours.  Pay for all food and all expenses.  The first weekend was close to a grand.  Then I trimmed it down and its roughly 500-700 a weekend with all expenses.  That is on top of the monthly child support and paying a lawyer.  I have completely wiped out my savings paying for all this and have no vacation time left at work.

The whole time my lawyer says, dont worry, this is only temporary.  Soon we will have a hearing for visitation and she will have to drive half way.  Awesome, I can do that.  Its still like 200 dollars in gas per visit, but I can manager that. 

So today, we have the hearing, I dont have to be there.  My lawyer emails me the paper work, and I cannot believe the huge dick I just took in the ass.  

So now, I have monthly visits starting in a week, going through September.  The trial is on September 1st for permanent visitation.  Oh, but any visit under 7 days, I have to do all the driving.  30 hours of driving over a 4 day period for the visits.  Or, I could just stay where they live, in a hotel, and pay for 5 nights in a hotel and take off work 3 days a month for the visits.  The only visits she has to met me half way are 3 visits in July, June and August because they are 2 week visits.

Who can afford something like this?  Money aside, lets say I could afford it, which I can't.  Who can take off 3 days of work a month?  That is 5 weeks a year in just time off work for visits?  Who can do that? 

So now, if I cannot meet this schedule, I am a dead beat dad right.  I am worthless.  I let my kids down.  I have to know, that the guy investigated for touching my daughter gets to tell them every night how much dad does not love them, or he would visit.  The courts say he can, why doesn't he?

Its fucked up man.  I feel worthless.  I feel like I have failed my kids.  My daughter needed me and what could I do?  Nothing.  Not a fucking thing.  Now I have to tell my son and daughter that their daddy cant make it.  Cant come and visit.  For what?  Because my dirty whore of an ex wife keeps spitting kids out and the courts side with her.  Oh, no, its ok, you have too many kids and cant fit them all in a vehicle, dont worry, we will make the dad drive.  You just keep having kids and we will keep paying for them.  Oh, and her fucking boyfriend, who has lived with her for 9 years, wont get a divorce from his wife.  My kids tell me stories about the shit he does.  He gave my 11 year old son a fucking cross bow for Christmas.  Not a toy, I have seen it.  A fucking cross bow.

When I skype with my kids, they have web cams setup in each room.   I see them.  Oh, they say, thats so mom can stay in her room with the new baby and watch us.  When we do something wrong, she calls us on these walkie talkies.  I am not making this up.  So the guy, under investigation for touching my daughter, has access to a webcam in her bedroom?  But none of this fucking matters.  None of it.  The state does not care.  The police have been to her house numerous times.  He has been arrested numerous times.  Oh, and they live 11 people, 9 kids and 2 adults, in a 2 bedroom house. Oh yes.  2 bedrooms.  

I live on 3 acres of land, with 2 spare bedrooms setup and waiting for their arrival, but that is not going to happen now.  What the actual fuck.  How is this possible?  How can our court system work like this?  How can the courts not see her situation for what it is?  How can they continue to let her abuse the situation and allow my kids to live like that when they have a great home just waiting for them?

Its enough to just say fuck it all.  Why do things right?  Why work hard and hire a lawyer?  What does it get you?  How does it even help you?  I.  I just dont understand.

tl:dr The court system screws yet another father

edit:  When I say keeping me from seeing them, I mean I have no idea where they live because she moves so much.  I only know now because of the paperwork I received from the state she lives in saying her boyfriend is being investigated by social services for touching my daughter.  Oh, which was dropped because he refused a polygraph.  The official report says it cannot confirm nor deny the accusation.  The home is still listed as being a high risk environment.  No follow up visits by social services.  Oh, and the month the investigation was happening, he was supposed to move out, but my ex wife sent my daughter to stay at a friends house for the month.  Then when social services said they could do nothing, she came home, to live with the guy she says touched her.  What the fuck.  How is that even possible legally.

Edit 2:  Here is the kick in the nuts.  Every year for 9 years, my kids have been able to go to my parents house for the whole summer, with one caveat.  If I even call my parents house while the kids are there, my ex wife swore my parents would never see them again.  So, I could not even call my own parents for 3 months out of the year and suffered that because my kids at least had a healthy environment and could see my parents for 3 months.  My ex wife did this for nothing more than spite.  The whole time my parents knew where my kids were and where the always lived, but were not allowed to tell me.",1361607143.0

We always did it as a free service but a rival bidder offered to pay for empty cartridges so we were naturally outbid. 

Since losing that contract to the other company, various people on the military base are still shipping toner to us and are even telling other areas to ship it to us because it's easier than whatever system the new company that replaced us has put in place.

My question is, is there some law or fine or whatever I am breaking? I cannot control who still insists on shipping me their old toners. It seems if the new company found out we are still getting product meant for them they would get irate. Same for the higher ups on the military base who get the money from the company for the toner.

I am a returned peace corps volunteer and lived abroad for three years, making many contacts.

On the e-QIP, I didn't list any foreign contacts because the words ""bounded by"" led me to believe more than just associates or friends. I have already submitted my e-QIP which cannot be changed. Now I need to submit my SF-86c (which I've included foreign contacts). 

Did I just screw myself? I need to list foreign contacts, but there can't be discrepancies between the e-QIP and SF-86c...Should I just submit it with the contacts and include a statement explaining the omission?

362,My experience with government waste,5,15tzx2,government,https://www.reddit.com/r/government/comments/15tzx2/my_experience_with_government_waste/,4,"TL;DR: I'm just one guy who is contracted to work on one military installation doing one unique task but if I see so much waste in what I see the entire scope of it must be in the billions!

I work for a company that sells printers and printer supplies to the local area. A few years ago we were asked by the local military installation if we handled toner recycling. We said we did and we're proud of it as it leads to less landfill waste. There isn't much money in it but you can make a few bucks at it after all the labor involved if you have OEM empty toners that refill companies desire. We make a couple hundred bucks a month doing this that doesn't even cover the labor of doing it. I think we do it just as a advertising tool really ""look, we are green!""

Anyway, we start picking up the military installation's supposed empty toners and it is a massive amount but then when sorting through the truck loads of the stuff we kept pulling out brand new toner that's never even been used. We figured this must have been some kind of mistake and inquire about it.

We are told there is no mistake that they give us all their 'un-wanted' toner (un-wanted as in new and empty/used) as they cannot throw anything away under the government's green rules and once they no longer have a printer in the office that uses that toner, it gets tossed into the used pile.

So what to do with all this brand new, most of the time OEM, unopened toner that was given to us mixed in with the junk? We put what we can sale locally on the shelves and what we wouldn't sell locally we sell online (dirt cheap to compete online). In a typical year I know we bring in about $75,000-$100,000 online and the locally sold stuff goes for a premium considering how expensive OEM toner can be.

Why are they throwing away never used toner? I asked why too. Each office (of hundreds on a typical military installation) has a yearly budget. Over the years they have fought to increase this budget to cover purchases they needed and now that they have the yearly budget needed to buy those new desks to replace those 10 year old ones, new chairs, new coffee maker, etc, etc they don't want to lose that dollar amount they worked so hard to get as their yearly budget.

So, now every year they have all this extra money in their budget after buying the usual yearly stuff as they already have new desks and new chairs. If they don't spend it next year their budget will be reduced the dollar amount they didn't spend so what do they do? They buy tons of extra toner, more than they could ever use, just to use up the money. Next year what do they do with the extra money? They buy all new printers (which use different toner) even though their current printers aren't old, aren't worn out, and have a stockroom packed with supplies for it.

Basically, toner is a easy spending spree and replacing printers is an even easier one as it will require replacing everything in the supply closet. That room full of brand new toner ends up in my shelves for sale thanks to the US Government and their screwed up budget system.

The worst part about it all? One building is throwing away XX type toner because they are now using YY type toner but the building next door still uses XX type toner. I've suggested 'why don't you give them your stockroom of toner since they still use it instead of throwing it away?' Their response is the building next door doesn't want it because that is free and that would throw their budget off at the end of the year and they need every penny gone!

Like I said, I see only one tiny amount of waste as one guy working on one military installation but can only imagine the big picture of budget spending sprees of replacing computers, desks, chairs, office supplies, etc that are only a year or so old. Depressing as a tax payer.",1357175137.0

The owner of the company I work for has kept every penny he could in the local economy.  He contributes about $1.2 million to the local economy every year and employs the unemployable when they are in need.  In a community of about 25,000 this makes a notable impact.  

He feels strongly it is his civic duty to keep his money local when many others search far and wide for the best deal.  Many small businesses in the area would have evaporated long ago if not for his patronage, but of course this is difficult to prove.  

Should I email City Council members first then attend a meeting?  Or is attending a meeting to raise the point a pretty standard first step?  Again, I understand every town over the world is different.  I am in the U.S.  I am just looking for some guidance, not exact steps to follow.  However, those would be appreciated too.

705,"SOPA 2.0!!!! NOT!!, people its not the same thing READ THIS [CISPA] ",9,s4zng,government,https://www.reddit.com/r/government/comments/s4zng/sopa_20_not_people_its_not_the_same_thing_read/,0,"The sponsors of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), a new cybersecurity bill in the House, assured a group of technology journalists and bloggers during a Tuesday morning conference call that their legislation has nothing to do with the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a highly controversial intellectual property bill that stalled in Congress earlier this year.

Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and sponsor of CISPA, stressed that while SOPA focused on intellectual property and copyright protection, his bill is intended only to protect American computer networks from cyberattacks in the name of national security.

“They are so completely different,” said Rogers, adding that comparing them is akin to “comparing apples and oranges.” He later added, “I think it’s extremely important we deal with the issue of SOPA. Clearly, there is no censorship or shutting any website down. The government doesn’t have any authority in this bill to do anything like this.”

The technology community has been standing guard for the next post-SOPA threat, and some Internet users think it’s come in the form of CISPA. Petitions against the bill and headlines such as “CISPA Is A Really Bad Bill, And Here’s Why” have already been appearing around the web. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group, promoting online freedom, has warned that CISPA’s language is dangerously broad.

Rogers defended the bill, saying CISPA isn’t concerned with “.mp3 files, movies or music” but rather with higher-end business’ intellectual property such as “pesticide formulas, jet engines and car parts.” These properties are being stolen in cyberattacks by other countries, giving foreign firms an unfair advantage in the global marketplace.

On the call, Rogers and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) also faced questions about how the bill defines “national security” — a category seen by many as broad and all-inclusive since the passing of the Patriot Act in 2001.

“This is very narrow in the sense that it has cybersecurity threats, so it has to pertain to networks.” said Rogers. “It is a cybersecurity focus, so that this is information that would be malicious source code, which would have to be the first part of that definition that would deal with getting into private networks for the purposes of cyber disruption or theft of property or, you know, fill in the blank, or criminal activity, I suppose, but criminal activity would be pretty hard to get to even under this bill.”

He later added that the bill would grant no new authority to the intelligence community or Department of Defense to require a “direct or indirect cybersecurity effort.” However, CISPA does call for the Director of National Intelligence to build channels for government intelligence to pass information to private companies, which would require a security clearance to receive classified information.

The bill’s authors said they were working with civil liberties groups including the American Civil Liberties Union to “get their point of view and make sure they’re heard.”

Rogers also pointed to the conference call as a first step in addressing the uproar from Internet users and civil liberties organizations.

“I think the thought is, this is serious business, we better make sure we’re doing this right,” he said. “We wanted to make sure we had this dialogue today to help people understand what’s in the bill. The language in there is really clear.”

SEE ALSO: Could CISPA Be the Next SOPA?
CISPA’s designed to allow and encourage the government and private businesses to share both classified and non-classified information about cyberthreats, including “efforts to degrade, disrupt or destroy” vital networks or “threat or misappropriation” of information owned by the government or private businesses, such as intellectual property.

The bill has passed committee and a full vote in the House is expected later this month. CISPA already enjoys the support of more than 100 cosponsors in the House and the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s top companies including Facebook and Microsoft — and that’s support SOPA never received.",1334207199.0

I’ve studied the Tea Party, I want you to know something: There is no Tea Party.

There is no Tea Party. You can’t go to Washington, D.C. and go to the Tea Party Headquarters Building, buzz on the buzzer, go into the lobby, steal a mint – ’cause that’s what you do - chat up the receptionist, and ask to talk to the president of the Tea Party. Why not?

There is no headquarters, there is no lobby, there is no receptionist, there is no mint, and there is no president of the Tea Party. This is an open-source brand, that 3,528 affiliates have agreed to use, but nobody owns. They operate off of an operating system called the “Contract From America”. The Contract From America was written by 100,000 people, as a wiki. Check this. This is an upgrade.

They talk – here’s the hypocrisy, the irony. They talk rugged individualism – that’s their whole schtick, right? This is the Tea Party. “If you had a problem, don’t look to the government. Just be more rugged, and more individual. ”

“And your problem will be solved”.

That’s their schtick, rugged individualism.

But they have enacted the most collectivist strategy for talking power in the history of the Republic. Because they use an open-source meta-brand that they all share, they wrote their document as a wiki, and they’re based on a principle and a value. And as a result, you now live in their world, twenty-four months after you thought we had changed everything.

Here’s the irony. They talk rugged individualist, but they act collectively. Where am I going? Where am I going? We talk, “kumbaya”; we talk, “Solidarity Forever!”; we talk, “Can’t we all get along?!”; but we have enacted the most individualistic approach to politics. “Why she’d get that grant!?” Did I get somebody?
